This is a stop gap measure to power my PoE cameras, it's ugly and inefficient, but cheap! Works fine and with just the cameras performance is less important!


### Planned

### Previous
Avaya 24 port 1gb managed switch
This was an older, no longer supported switch and required extra equipment to get working. Much more hassle than it's worth.

Cisco 24 port 100mb managed switch
This was an older, no longer supported model and worked great with little configuration. However, 100mb was to slow for my server, HA and my desktop.
